# PARA (Paste and Run Anything)

### Description: 

PARA is a team project developed in close collaboration of JetBrains (our client). We built an Intellij plugin that automatically installs missing java dependencies. The plugin compares a semantic/database-driven approach with an AI-based approach for resolving unresolved methods and classes. (Feb. 2025)

#### My noteable contributions:
- Implemented Java parsing using Intellij's PSI tree to identify and classify unresolved classes and methods, as well as determining class ownership of unresolved methods;
- Designed initial project structure, and integrated all core action listeners;
- Developed Unit tests and tests classes to validate all my implementations.

#### Team achievements:
- Collaborated closely with JetBrains engineers, holding weekly meetings to align requirements and technical direction;
- Received a 9/10 evaluation from JetBrains.

Note: Source code cannot be shared due to NDA restrictions.
