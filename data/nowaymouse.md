# nowaymouse,

### Description: 

nowaymouse is a Open-Source tool developed by me in Go and Python, designed to provide smooth and precise keyboard-driven control over the mouse pointer on wlroots based wayland compositors, such as Sway, Hyprland, and Wayfire.

---

### Key Features:
- Keyboard control: It enables users to control precise mouse movements and actions (clicks and scrolls) via key strokes;
- Grid navigation: It displays a triggerable overlay that divides the screen into segments, allowing pointer snapping to grids mapped to specific keys;
- Customizable UX: Offers flexible key bindings and overlay visuals through user configuration.,
